  In this project I utilized Asynchronous functions to communicate client/server side using XMLHTTPRequests.
The application allows the user to Schedule appointments, Cancels Appointments, and check all available appointments.
When a user schedules an appointment the server removes the time from the available time & appends it back into the avaialble times.
